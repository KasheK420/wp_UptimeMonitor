== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin check if a device is online? =

The plugin uses the ping functionality to check if devices are online. For websites, it can also use an HTTP request to verify if the website is responsive.

= How often does the plugin check device status? =

By default, the plugin checks device status hourly. You can adjust this in the settings to check twice hourly or daily.

= Can I monitor external websites or just my own servers? =

You can monitor any device or website that can be reached from your WordPress server, including external websites, routers, servers, or any other device with an IP address.

= Will this plugin slow down my website? =

No. The status checking runs in the background using WordPress cron jobs and doesn't affect your website's performance. The status display is lightweight and optimized for performance.

= Does this plugin work with caching plugins? =

Yes, the plugin is compatible with most caching plugins. However, for real-time status updates, you might need to adjust your caching settings.

= Can I receive notifications when a device goes down? =

Yes, the plugin includes email notification functionality that can alert you when a device status changes.
